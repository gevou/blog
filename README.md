# A statically generated blog example using Next.js, Markdown, and TypeScript

This is the existing [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) plus TypeScript.

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.

To create the blog posts we use [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) to convert the Markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every post is handled by [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and also sent in props to the page.

## How to use

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions).

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

# Notes

This blog-starter-typescript uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). To control the generated stylesheet's filesize, this example uses Tailwind CSS' v2.0 [`purge` option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#removing-unused-css) to remove unused CSS.

[Tailwind CSS v2.0 no longer supports Node.js 8 or 10](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2#upgrade-to-node-js-12-13-or-higher). To build your CSS you'll need to ensure you are running Node.js 12.13.0 or higher in both your local and CI environments.
